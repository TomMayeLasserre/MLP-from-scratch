# MLP from Scratch

## Description

This project implements a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** from scratch using Python and NumPy. It includes a custom MLP architecture along with scripts for training, testing, and explaining the mathematical principles behind the MLP.

## Project Structure

- `MLP.py`: Contains the implementation of the Multilayer Perceptron model.
- `MLP_maths_explenation.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that explains the mathematical foundation of the MLP, including forward and backward propagation.
- `MLP_train_test.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for training and testing the MLP on a dataset.

## Features

- **Custom MLP implementation**: Written from scratch using basic Python and NumPy, without using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Mathematical explanations**: Provides a detailed explanation of the forward pass and backpropagation in the MLP.
- **Training and Testing**: Includes a notebook for training the model on your dataset and evaluating the performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
